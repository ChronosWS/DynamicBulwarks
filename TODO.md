# Bug Fixes
* Revive issues (maybe add in http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=24088)?
* Long start time for some waves
* Vehicles stick around based on timer, not wave
* Player corpses stick around based on timer
* Guns sometimes get removed when accessing gear
* Are ammo drops happening in the right place?
  * No, the target waypoint is always the same location, random drift of the parachute is what causes it to actually end up in random places.
* missionLoop is a tight while loop
* Also it seems the first aid kits dropped by nato allow healing but the others dont when using PIR


# New Features
* DONE: Finish the lobby system
* Scaling vehicle waves (maybe with a vehicle costing table and wave budget), https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/CfgVehicles_Config_Reference#cost
* AI target buildings with grenades/explosives
  * Needs investigation - destroy waypoints
* Faction-based enemies
* Tweak spawn list to remove backpacks and other useless spawn items
* Spawn groups?
* Spawns between waves?
